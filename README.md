# Object-detection-on-Necklace- 
# 💍 Necklace Type Object Detection using CNN 
   
## 📘 Overview    
This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection model for identifying different types of necklaces in images. The aim is to build a robust system that can automatically detect, classify, and locate necklace types for use in e-commerce, jewelry cataloging, or digital inventory management.   
        
## 🎯 Objective             
To design an end-to-end object detection pipeline that:                 
- Processes image data of various necklace types (chains, pendants, chokers, etc.)                
- Trains a CNN or detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster-R-CNN) to detect and classify necklace types            
-  Evaluates model performance and demonstrates a real-world inference use-case        
          
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies         
Python • TensorFlow / Keras • OpenCV • CNN architectures (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) • NumPy • Matplotlib • Jupyter Notebook
 
## 🧮 Approach  
1. Data collection & preprocessing: image resizing, normalization, annotation of bounding boxes  
2. Model construction: selecting an appropriate object detection architecture, setting up training pipeline   
3. Training & validation: splitting data into train/val/test sets, applying augmentation, monitoring metrics  
4. Inference & evaluation: running the model on new images, calculating metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision), IoU (Intersection over Union)  
5. Deployment / usage: providing a script or notebook to input a sample image and output detected necklace type(s) with bounding boxes

## 📈 Key Results  
- Successfully detected ~ N different necklace types with correct bounding boxes  
- Business insight: Jewelry e-commerce systems can auto-categorize products, reduce manual labelling, and improve search/filter for users
